# 68K00
68000 Board EAGLE/VHDL
This repository contains EAGLE and VHDL sources for a 68000 based SBC. The ECB based SBC provides a 68000 cpu, 24 bit address and 16bit databus, 1 or 2 MB SRAM and up to 512KB FLASH on board, 12(C)887 RTC. It can be used with the GDP-FPGA (https://github.com/THemmecke/GDPFPGAII) to constitute a complete microcomputer system.
